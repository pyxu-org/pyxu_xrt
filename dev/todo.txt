    DASK inputs don't work correctly
    Debug history
        ray.py [check stash]
            add dask implementations
                why is "got here" printed twice? -> due to vectorize()
                    but why is it so slow?

                cutting nt_spec -> ok (always)
                cutting x_da -> nok (accumulates error due to box misses I think)
                    _drjit: robustize
                        L278: active rays must have at least one non-negligeable origin coord on axis

            adjoint(dask) pending
            move to extension module
